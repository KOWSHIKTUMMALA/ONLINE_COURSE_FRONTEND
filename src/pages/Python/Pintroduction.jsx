                <h3>Introduction to Python Programming</h3>

<p>Python is a widely used high-level, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.&nbsp;Python&nbsp;is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</p>

<h3>What can we do with Python?</h3>

<p>Python is used for:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Why Learn Python?</h3>

<p>Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, both have their own benefits.</p>

<h4>For Beginners:</h4>

<ul>
    <li><b>Easy Syntax:</b>&nbsp;Python syntax is like plain English, which allows you to focus on logic instead of worrying about complex rules.</li>
    <li><b>Built-in Libraries for Beginners:</b>&nbsp;Python has beginner friendly libraries like random, re, os etc, which can be used while learning fundamentals.</li>
    <li><b>Error Friendly:</b>&nbsp;Python’s error messages are easy to understand and debug.</li>

</ul>

<h4>For Experienced:</h4>

<ul>
    <li><b>Easy Career Transition:</b>&nbsp;If you know any other programming language, moving to Python is super easy.</li>
    <li><b>Great for Upskilling:</b>&nbsp;Moving to Python expands your skill sets and gives opportunity to work in areas like AI, Data Science, web development etc.</li>
    <li><b>High Demand of Python in Emerging tech:</b>&nbsp;Python is widely used in trending domains, like Data Science, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing etc.</li>
    <li><b>Bridge Between Roles:</b>&nbsp;For software developers working with different language, learning Python can help you integrate advanced features like AI in your projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hello World in Python</h3>

<p>Hello, World! in python&nbsp;is the first python program which we learn when we start learning any program. It’s a simple program that displays the message “Hello, World!” on the screen.</p>

<p>Here’s the “Hello World” program:</p>

<pre>
print("Hello, World!")
</pre>

<div className="output">
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
</div>

<h3>How does this work:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><code>print()</code>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;built-in function&nbsp;in Python that tells the program to display something on the screen. We need to add the string in parenthesis of print() function that we are displaying on the screen.</li>
    <li>“Hello, World!” is a string text that we want to display. Strings are always enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python Comments</h3>

<p>Comments in Python&nbsp;are the lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter during the execution of the program.</p>

<p>Comments enhance the readability of the code.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Comment can be used to identify functionality or structure the code-base.</li>
    <li>Comment can help understanding unusual or tricky scenarios handled by the code to prevent accidental removal or changes.</li>
    <li>Comments can be used to prevent executing any specific part of your code, while making changes or testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<pre>{`# I am single line comment
""" Multi-line comment used
print("Python Comments")
"""
`}</pre>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>In Python, single line comments starts with hashtag&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;#.</li>
    <li>Python ignores the string literals that are not assigned to a variable. So, we can use these string literals as Python Comments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Indentation in Python</h3>

<p>In Python, indentation is used to define blocks of code. It tells the Python interpreter that a group of statements belongs to a specific block. All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block. Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<pre>{`if 10 > 5:
    print("This is true!")
    print("I am tab indentation")
print("I have no indentation")
`}</pre>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The first two print statements are indented by 4 spaces, so they belong to the if block.</li>
    <li>The third print statement is not indented, so it is outside the if block.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Famous Application Built using Python</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>YouTube:</b>&nbsp;World’s largest video-sharing platform uses Python for features like video streaming and backend services.</li>
    <li><b>Instagram:</b>&nbsp;This popular social media app relies on Python’s simplicity for scaling and handling millions of users.</li>
